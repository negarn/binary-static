Under these contracts and subject to the specific terms of the relevant contract, in consideration for the premium or price that clients pay BIEL, BIEL promises to pay clients a certain amount if the reference assets or measurements perform in a particular manner. These contracts accordingly are not instruments that BIEL holds on clients&#x27; behalf and neither benefits from clients&#x27; assets protection in the event of BIEL&#x27;s insolvency.

If a Client&#x27;s Margin Level is less than the Margin Level set for their account, the Client has entered into a Margin Call and is required to increase their Margin Level above the account&#x27;s specified level in order to avoid a Stop Out to occur.

The negative balance is determined by aggregating all the negative balances incurred over a 24-hour period across all accounts held by the Client. The Client acknowledges that, unless they are a retail customer of Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd, the offer of the Negative Balance protection by the Company to the Client is at the Company&#x27;s sole discretion and the Company reserves the right to change the features and eligibility criteria of the Negative Balance Protection at any time.

In such cases, the automatic Margin close-out protection might fail, causing the Client&#x27;s Account Balance to fall below zero. For this purpose, a Negative Balance Protection mechanism has been introduced. Negative Balance Protection provides a &#x27;backstop&#x27; in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that the Client&#x27;s maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on the Client&#x27;s CFD account. Therefore, the Client can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if the Client&#x27;s CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to the Client.</p><p>Negative Balance Protection does not apply to the Clients categorised as Professional Traders, who can still lose more money than their available balance.</p><p>The Company does not offer credit to its Clients. The Client acknowledges and agrees that they will not be dealing with the Company on credit.</p></li></ol></li><li><strong>账户关闭</strong><p>If the Client wishes to withdraw funds from their MT5 Real Account and/or close their MT5 Real Account, the Client may notify the Company by contacting the helpdesk at <a href="mailto:support@binary.com">support@binary.com</a>.

The purpose of this filtering algorithm is to strip the feed of stray ticks. Stray ticks are ticks that manifestly fall outside of the current trading range of the market; such ticks are often due to communication delays with the exchanges or banks that provide quotes, human error, or database problems at any point between the originator of the quote and the Company&#x27;s servers.</p><p>The filtering algorithm may for example be similar to the &quot;Bollinger Bands&quot; volatility system, i.e. short-term volatility bands are determined around the present market value, and ticks that are manifestly outside of such bands are removed.</p><h2 data-anchor="smoothing-out-random-noise">消除随机噪声</h2><p>Depending on the quality of the feeds received from the Company&#x27;s feed providers, the Company&#x27;s servers might also apply a very short-term smoothing algorithm to the data feed. This smoothing algorithm removes a little of the &quot;random noise&quot; surrounding the data feed and ensures that clients who buy path-dependent contracts (such as the one-touch or barrier-range contracts) will not have their contracts knocked in or knocked out by random short-term market noise that does not reflect the true market price.</p><h2 data-anchor="differences-with-other-data-feeds">与其他数据源的差异</h2><p>The Company&#x27;s data feed may at times differ slightly from other data feeds found on the Internet (who may themselves differ from each other). Reasons for differences in feed providers include:</p><ul><li>For forex: The forex market is an OTC (over the counter) market, where banks and other major financial institutions trade currencies amongst themselves without there being any central clearing house. Accordingly, there is no &#x27;official&#x27; price source for forex quotes. Different data feeds will contain quotes from a different sub-set of international banks. Accordingly, prices may differ among providers, depending on which bank(s) they obtain prices from.</li><li>上述平滑和滤波算法。</li><li>Market-closing times: The client is asked to refer to <a href="/binary-static/zh_cn/resources/market_timesws.html">Trading times</a> page for the exact time of settlement for all contracts. Other websites may adopt a different convention (for example, some websites choose 4 o&#x27;clock NY time or 5 o&#x27;clock London time). As a result, the open, high, low, and closing prices displayed on the Company&#x27;s website may differ from those on other websites, due to the market-closing time convention.</li><li>Use of bid/ask prices: When the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many bid and ask prices, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the bid/ask price (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. The Company&#x27;s system will generate prices from these bid and ask prices, whereas other websites might not. As a result, the Company&#x27;s website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.</li></ul><p>The Company&#x27;s data feed is designed to be one of the best and most robust available for a trading environment.</p><h2 data-anchor="weekend-quotes">周末报价</h2><p>The client is asked to note that weekend quotes are ignored for the purpose of contract settlement. During weekends, the forex markets may occasionally generate prices; however, these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push prices up or down). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is Binary.com&#x27;s policy not to count weekend prices towards contract settlement values (except for Volatility Indices, which are open during weekends).</p></div></div><div id="privacy-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="security-and-privacy">安全隐私</h2><p>The Company recognises the importance of protecting the client&#x27;s personal and financial information.</p><p>公司获得的所有客户的信息有助于公司为客户和其账户提供服务。公司了解客户可能会对公司处理此类信息的方式感到忧虑。</p><p>The Company has outlined the Company&#x27;s privacy practices for the client as follows:</p><h2 data-anchor="use-of-information">Use of information</h2><p>The Company operates in full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable Data Protection laws. These regulatory measures place obligations on users of personal data like the Company. They also lay down the principles for fair and lawful processing of all the information that the Company acquires.</p><p>It is the Company&#x27;s commitment to safeguard the client&#x27;s privacy online at all times. The Company only uses the client&#x27;s personal information to help the Company service the client&#x27;s account, to improve the Company&#x27;s services to the client, and to provide the client with products that the client has requested. The Company does not sell the client&#x27;s personal information to third parties, but the Company may provide it to payment providers to facilitate transactions on the client&#x27;s account.</p><p>The client&#x27;s personal information is used primarily as a way of validating the client as the legitimate account owner and proper recipient of withdrawal payments. The Company also uses this information to process the client&#x27;s trades. The Company collects from the client all personal and financial data directly relating to the client when the client fills in the Company&#x27;s account opening form. In all instances, the client has either a legal or a contractual obligation to provide the Company with the information. If such information is not provided, the Company will be unable to provide the client with its services.</p><p>The Company reserves the right to request further information from the client whenever deemed appropriate under the circumstances. For example, the Company may ask the client to send the Company additional acceptable documents to confirm the authenticity of the client&#x27;s account details or of any withdrawal request.</p><p>The Company holds all the personal data that the Company collects from the client with due diligence and only processes them for purposes as required or allowed by law. This includes the process of obtaining and sharing of certain information with third parties for credit or identity checks to comply with legal and regulatory obligations. In certain cases, the Company may process the client&#x27;s data to fulfill the Company&#x27;s contractual obligations with the client.</p><p>The Company also collects basic tax residence information for the purposes of CRS/FATCA compliance. The tax information that the client provides may only be disclosed to the authorities who are legally charged with collecting this information for CRS/FATCA reporting, and Binary.com will only do so to the extent that is legally obliged to collect it from the clients and disclose it to the authorities. The Company does not use, disclose, or process this information in any other way at any time.</p><p>The client may update the client&#x27;s personal information at any time by logging in to the &quot;Settings&quot; section of the client&#x27;s account. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that Binary.com is promptly and continually informed of any change in the client&#x27;s personal information. The client should note that if the client provides the Company with inaccurate information, or if the client fails to notify the Company of any changes to the information previously supplied by the client, this may adversely affect the quality of the services that the Company can provide.</p><h2 data-anchor="profiling-and-categorisation">Profiling and categorisation</h2><p>The Company collects and assesses the client&#x27;s data to profile the client in relation to the Company&#x27;s products. The Company does this manually with the assistance of automated processing. By categorisation, the Company will be able to provide the most appropriate products and services to the client.</p><h2 data-anchor="cookies-and-device-information">Cookies and device information</h2><p>Cookies are small text files stored on computer drives and are widely used in order to make websites work and to improve the user experience. All recent versions of browsers give the client a level of control over cookies. The client can delete all cookies that are already on the client&#x27;s computer and the browser can be set to prevent them from being placed. However, if the client chooses not to receive the Company&#x27;s cookies, the full usability of the Company&#x27;s website may be adversely affected.</p><p>The client should note that the Company&#x27;s website generates log files that record the IP addresses of accesses to the client&#x27;s account, login attempts, and device information such as the manufacturer, model, operating system, and browser. This information is gathered for the sole purpose of providing assistance with investigating a client&#x27;s account in the unlikely event that the account is accessed by unauthorised users. Information supplied by some cookies also helps the Company understand how visitors use the website, so that the Company can improve how it presents its content.</p><p>The Company&#x27;s cookies are not deemed dangerous and cannot access any other information on the client&#x27;s computer.</p><p>通过使用Binary.com的网站或与网站交互，客户同意允许使用Google分析用户 ID 功能，从而允许Google捕获客户的 Binary.com 登录 ID （例如，VRTC1234与MT1234 等）。启用此功能后，除Binary.com登录 ID 或其他可以让Google链接到此类信息的数据以外，将没有任何其他个人身份信息与Google共享或披露给Google。</p><div data-show="eucountry"><h2 data-anchor="transfer-of-data">Transfer of data</h2><p>The Company may also transfer relevant personal and financial data to any company within the Binary Group of companies. This includes any of the Company&#x27;s business associates or payment providers within or outside of the EEA, including countries that might not offer an equivalent level of protection of personal data. In all instances, the Company places a contractual obligation on such third parties to offer the same level of rights and protection as stipulated in the GDPR.</p><p>The client also has the right to request copies of any personal information that the client has provided to the Company and to request that the Company transmit such information to other service providers.</p><h2 data-anchor="consent">同意</h2><p>When the client opens an account with the Company, the Company will request the client&#x27;s consent for the distribution of marketing materials to the e-mail address that the client provides to the Company upon sign-up.</p><h2 data-anchor="right-of-object">Right to object</h2><p>The client has the right to object to the direct distribution of marketing materials. This can be done by either not providing the client&#x27;s consent to any marketing material before the service is rendered or revoking it at any point during the service. In both cases, the Company will refrain from distributing marketing materials to the client.</p><h2 data-anchor="access-to-personal-data">个人数据访问</h2><p>除非Binary.com的关键人员在执行职务时有此必要，严格禁止任何人访问客户的个人数据。</p><p>If Binary.com is legally required to disclose the client&#x27;s personal or financial information by law, regulation, or pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a governmental agency, the Company will promptly notify the client, as it deems appropriate, to give the client the opportunity to seek protection for the information. The Company will do so unless legally prohibited. Such required disclosure shall not be interpreted as a breach of this terms and conditions agreement.</p><p>The client also has the right to request that the Company copy, modify, or remove the client&#x27;s personal information as long as such actions do not breach any legal or regulatory obligations that the Company may have.</p></div><h2 data-anchor="data-retention">数据保留</h2><p>If the client chooses to close the client&#x27;s Binary.com account, the client&#x27;s data will be kept only until the Company&#x27;s legal and regulatory obligations on data retention are met. The Company will delete the client&#x27;s data once the applicable retention period expires.</p><h2 data-anchor="security-statement">Security statement</h2><p>Taking the following measures, the Company is committed to making sure that the client&#x27;s personal data and transactions are secure:</p><ol><li>The client&#x27;s password and login ID are unique, and passwords are hashed so that not even Binary.com staff can read them. This is the reason why the Company cannot retrieve the client&#x27;s password and has to issue the client with a new one, sent to the client&#x27;s email address, if the client cannot recall it.</li><li>The Company maintains customer balances in cash or cash equivalent. The Company ensures that 100% of each customer&#x27;s balance is available for immediate withdrawal, subject to verification.</li><li>所有信用卡信息都按照银行政策，使用最新 SSL 加密技术直接提交至 Visa/Mastercard 网络。</li><li>The Company&#x27;s information security policies are based on industry best practices in access control and business continuity.</li><li>The Company uses identity verification services and real-time fraud detection measures to help protect the client from unauthorised access to the client&#x27;s account. The Company also monitors account activity for signs of unusual activity that might indicate fraud and work with collection and law-enforcement agencies to address fraud issues.</li><li>The client is responsible for keeping the client&#x27;s log-in details secure, the security of any linked email address, and the security (password protection, screen locking, etc) of any personal computer or device on which the client&#x27;s account is accessible.

Such independence-upholding procedures can be followed, for example, through the operation of information barriers, physical separation of staff, the segregation of duties and responsibilities, and the maintenance of a policy of independence, which requires the Company&#x27;s staff, when providing services to a client, to act in the best interests of the client and to disregard any conflicts of interest, or in some circumstances, to decline to act for a client or potential client in order to avoid conflicts of interest.</p><h2 data-anchor="disclosure-general">揭露：一般</h2><p>The organisational and administrative arrangements established by the Company to prevent or manage the conflict are not sufficient to ensure, with reasonable confidence, that the risk of damage to the interest of the client will be prevented.

If the client is in any doubt about the risks involved with Investment Products or Gambling Products, the client should seek professional advice.</p><p>If the client chooses to enter into a contract with the Company, it is important that the client remains aware of the risks involved, that the client has adequate investment resources to bear such risks, and that the client monitors the client&#x27;s positions carefully.</p><h2 data-anchor="general-risks">General risks</h2><p></p><h4>No advice</h4><p>The Company&#x27;s services are provided on an execution-only basis. The Company does not provide investment advice in relation to the Company&#x27;s products or services.

However, any decision to use the Company&#x27;s products or services is made by the client.</p><p>The client is responsible for managing the client&#x27;s tax and legal affairs, including making any regulatory filings and payments and complying with applicable laws and regulations. The Company does not provide any regulatory, tax, or legal advice. If the client is in any doubt as to the tax treatment or liabilities of Investment Products or Gambling Products available through Binary.com, the client may wish to seek independent advice.</p><h4>合适性</h4><p>Investment Products to EEA residents are provided by Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd (&quot;BIEL&quot;), which is authorised and regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority under the Malta Investment Services Act to deal on own account in Investment Products.</p><p>在为客户开立 BIEL账户，对投资产品进行交易或投资之前，公司要先根据客户提供的信息对客户所选择的投资产品或服务作出评估。如果对客户不合适，公司必须提醒客户。最后，由客户自行决定是否开立账户，并使用公司产品或服务。客户应充分了解公司产品和服务的风险，并承担所有责任。</p><p>在申请过程中，公司可能会向客户索取其背景、经历以及投资资产和收入等信息。公司不会代表客户监控这些信息是否与其支付的金额、盈利或亏损有关联。由客户全权负责评估自己的投资资源是否能够支持投资活动，并自行负担使用产品和服务的风险。</p><h4>Need to monitor positions</h4><p>It is important that the client monitor all of the client&#x27;s positions closely. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to monitor the client&#x27;s positions, and during the period that the client has any open contracts, the client should always have the ability to access the client&#x27;s accounts.</p><div data-show="eucountry"><h4>默认值</h4><p>Since BIEL is a member of the Malta Investor Compensation Scheme, the client is covered for the first €20,000 of any claim that the client may have in the unlikely event of BIEL suffering an investment default and not being able to meet its obligations.

Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal, and other risks involved in such transactions. The client should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for the client in light of the client&#x27;s investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. The client should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless the client understands the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If the client is in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for the client, the client should seek independent advice from an investment consulting professional. Binary.com does not provide such advice. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility, taking into account the client&#x27;s personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in Binary Options with Binary.com and prior to making any individual order. Where the client does not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with Binary.com or in making any individual order, the client should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If the client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, the client should not trade at all.</p><p>The client is advised that the Binary Options offered by Binary.com are not traded under the rules of any recognised, designated, or regulated exchange. Consequently, engaging in Binary Options trading may expose the client to substantially greater risks than the investments that are so traded.</p><p>The client is warned of the following additional risks:</p><p>Derivative investment instruments such as Binary Options and related markets can be highly volatile. The prices of the underlying instrument that a Binary Option refers to may fluctuate rapidly and over wide ranges and may reflect unforeseeable events or changes in conditions, none of which can be controlled by the client or Binary.com.</p><p>Binary.com 努力让二元期权所提交的每个标的资产报价与该资产的实际市价保持合理的关系。Binary.com 不保证、表达或意味着所报的价代表市价。</p><p>Binary.com 可能有权限获取客户所无法得到的信息，也可能以客户无法得到的低价获取交易头寸，并可能跟客户的利益有所不同。Binary.com 没有义务为客户提供公司所拥有的市场或其他信息，也不会对公司自己的交易做出任何变更或限制。</p><p>任何标的工具或资产上一次的表现不可保证其当前或未来的表现。以前的表现并不能作为未来结果的可靠指标。</p><h2 data-anchor="risks-of-investment-products">产品投资风险</h2><p>Investing or trading in contracts exposes the client to the performance of the underlying or reference instrument or asset to which the Binary contract refers, including foreign exchange, indices, and commodities, each of which have their own features and risks.</p><p>Exchange Rate Risk: Exchange rates between foreign currencies can change rapidly due to a wide range of economic, political, and other conditions, exposing the client to the risk of exchange rate losses in addition to the inherent risk of loss from trading the underlying Investment Product. If the client deposits funds in a currency to trade contracts denominated in a different currency, the client&#x27;s gains or losses on the underlying investment may be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the currencies.</p><p>Other Risks: There are other risks related to trading Investment Products and foreign currencies that cannot be described in detail in this document. Generally, however, securities, options, and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. For example, there can be serious market disruptions if local or overseas economic, political, or other unforeseen events affect the market. In addition to these types of risk, there may be other factors such as accounting and tax treatment issues that the client should consider.</p><h2 data-anchor="market-opinions">Market opinions</h2><p>网站所载的一切意见、新闻、研究、分析、价格和其他信息都是一般的市场评论，不构成投资建议。Binary.com 将不会承担任何损失或损害，包括但不限于使用或依赖该信息造成的直接或间接利润损失。</p><h2 data-anchor="internet-trading-risks">Internet trading risks</h2><p>There are risks associated with utilising an Internet-based deal execution trading system, including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connection.

The client should be aware of all costs and charges that apply to the client because they will affect the client&#x27;s profitability.</p><h2 data-anchor="cryptocurrency-risks">Cryptocurrency risks</h2><p>Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets that are extremely vulnerable to market fluctuations. Trading in cryptocurrencies is a highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down — potentially to a worthless (zero) value. The client should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless the client fully understands and is aware that trades and/or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature, and the client not only risks incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risks losing all the client&#x27;s invested capital.</p><p>If the client loses the client&#x27;s cryptocurrencies as a result of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers being hacked or becoming insolvent, there is no assurance of a recourse. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to store the client&#x27;s cryptocurrencies securely. Binary.com will not accept liability for any loss or damage that arises, directly or indirectly, from the theft of the client&#x27;s cryptocurrency or the insolvency of exchanges and wallet providers that the client uses.</p><p>Cryptocurrency-related transactions that occur on the blockchain might take place without the supervision and regulation of financial institutions and government agencies. The absence of an overarching authority overseeing cryptographic transactions means that there is no recourse to banks, payment service providers, or regulators in the event of erroneous or fraudulent transactions. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to check what rules and protections apply in the client&#x27;s relevant jurisdiction before investing and/or trading in virtual currency and/or trading on contracts for differences relating to virtual currency. The client should be aware of all the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor and/or legal advisor if the client has any doubts.</p></div></div><div id="risk-mt-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="risk-disclosure-statement">Risk disclosure statement</h2><p>This risk disclosure statement is not exhaustive and is not intended to constitute a comprehensive statement of all the risks to which the client might be exposed and does not describe all the risks inherent to forex and contracts for differences that exist now or which may arise in the future. Its objective is rather to provide the client with information, so that the client can reasonably understand the risks associated with forex and contracts for differences offered by Binary.com, as it is the Company&#x27;s intention to provide the client with the best possible trading experience.</p><h2 data-anchor="forex-and-cfd-high-risk">外汇和差价交易合约涉及高风险，是一种投机活动</h2><p>Forex and contract for differences transactions involve a high degree of risk and are speculative because they allow the client to speculate on the short-term price movements of the underlying financial instruments. The client should not enter into forex and/or contract-for-difference transactions unless the client is able to sustain losses that exceed the client&#x27;s deposited funds. It is important for the client to understand that in order to realise any value from the client&#x27;s open positions, the client would have to enter into a corresponding transaction to close the client&#x27;s open positions and may find it difficult or impossible to do so under certain market conditions.</p><h2 data-anchor="execution-model">执行模型和交易对手风险</h2><p>Binary.com通过一系列的模式提供外汇和差价合约，即通过自己的账户（交易员）和全对冲客户订单与公司的流动率提供商（无交易员）或混合模式进行交易，视公司与客户是否有合约而定。如是混合模式，当总交易量超过预定的风险承受力水平限额时，客户订单通常被对冲。Binary.com在此类执行模式中都扮演客户与公司签订交易的合约相对方，而不是像交易所的交易金融工具那样与中央结算所订立交易的合约相对方。 因此，存在相对方风险。 相对方风险是指客户因为其签订的外汇和/或差价交易合约相对方在交易现金流最终结算前违反其义务而造成的损失风险。</p><h2 data-anchor="leverage">杠杆</h2><p>Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that the client would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than the client&#x27;s margin. When the client invests in a leveraged product, the client&#x27;s profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e. the increased/amplified value of the client&#x27;s trade is determined based on the leverage ratio that the client has set for the client&#x27;s account.</p><p>Leverage can be used to generate returns that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction (the client&#x27;s margin). However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against the client&#x27;s favour, the client will suffer losses that are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction (the client&#x27;s margin).</p><h2 data-anchor="relationship-between-margin-and-leverage">Relationship between margin and leverage</h2><p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times that the client&#x27;s margin (the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be &quot;leveraged&quot; to enter into a transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always one. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that the Company/the client establishes will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, as the leverage that the client sets for the client&#x27;s account gets lower, the margin required to be set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance (the client&#x27;s margin requirement) gets higher.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-stop-order">Risk of stop order</h2><p>The system fills orders on a first-in, first-out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond the Company&#x27;s control. As a result, the client may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in the client&#x27;s stop order during certain market conditions. The placement of stop order by the client, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit the client&#x27;s losses to the client&#x27;s intended amounts in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders, and there is uncertainty about the client&#x27;s possible exit price. In short, a stop order is not guaranteed because it cannot operate in all market circumstances.</p><h2 data-anchor="regular-monitoring">定期监测未平仓头寸</h2><p>Trading forex and contracts for differences carries a high level of risk and Binary.com does not monitor the open positions of the client&#x27;s account on the client&#x27;s behalf. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to monitor the client&#x27;s open positions and understand the exposure of the client&#x27;s open positions whilst ensuring that the client&#x27;s exposure commensurate with the client&#x27;s risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, the client should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which the client ordinarily transacts instead of investing in a CFD.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-slippage">滑点风险</h2><p>Whilst the Company endeavours to open or close the transaction to which the client&#x27;s orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with the Company&#x27;s duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that the client&#x27;s order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when the client places their order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to the client) or a negative slippage (less favourable to the client).</p><h2 data-anchor="external-forces">外部力量</h2><p>The client&#x27;s forex and contract-for-difference transactions with Binary.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument, and the client will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate, or other volatility of the market to which the client&#x27;s financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to the client. Forex and contract-for-difference trading over the Internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk, which may result in delays in order execution.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-cryptocurrency-cfd">Risk of cryptocurrency contracts for differences</h2><p>Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets that are extremely vulnerable to market fluctuations. Trading cryptocurrency contracts for differences is a highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down — potentially to a worthless (zero) value. Investing in cryptocurrency contracts for differences through leveraged accounts amplifies this underlying volatility risk, making the change in prices even more significant. When the client invests in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, the client&#x27;s profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio that the client has set for the client&#x27;s account. If the price movement is in the client&#x27;s favour, returns generated are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against the client&#x27;s favour, the client will suffer losses that are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction. The client should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless the client fully understands and is aware that trades and/or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature, and the client not only risks incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risks losing all the client&#x27;s invested capital.</p></div></div><div id="order-execution-binary-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="summary-order-execution-policy">订单执行政策摘要</h2><p>The Company has a general duty to conduct its business with the client honestly, fairly, and professionally and to act in the client&#x27;s best interests when opening and closing Binary Options trades with the client.</p><p>More specifically, when the Company enters into a Binary Option trade with the client (each, a &quot;Contract&quot;), the Company has a duty to provide the client with &#x27;best execution&#x27;.
