Essas regras podem mudar ocasionalmente de acordo com as condições do mercado e outros fatores. As seguintes regras indicativas estão atualmente implementadas:<ul class="bullet"><li>Os contratos não serão, por norma, disponibilizados com odds abaixo de 0,05 a 1 (ou seja, pagamentos inferiores a 1,05 USD/GBP/EUR/AUD por cada 1 USD/GBP/EUR/AUD apostado).</li><li>Os contratos disponibilizados pela Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd. têm um preço mínimo de aquisição de 5 USD/GBP/EUR.</li><li>Os contratos não são, por norma, disponibilizados na última hora de negociação de nenhum mercado específico (para os mercados de bolsas de valores, a restrição pode ser estendida em até 3 horas).</li><li>Os contratos não serão, por norma, disponibilizados quando o mercado subjacente se encontrar na sua alta ou queda intradiárias.</li><li>Os contratos não serão, por norma, disponibilizados durante os primeiros 10 minutos da negociação de mercado.</li><li>Durante os fast markets (mercados com negociação rápida, isto é, períodos de movimentos muito rápidos do mercado), os contratos podem ser disponibilizados a preços mais desfavoráveis do que os disponibilizados em condições usuais de mercado.</li><li>Certos limites são aplicados no que diz respeito aos níveis aceitáveis para os preços barreira/limite dos contratos. Por norma, a barreira/limite não pode ser muito próxima nem muito afastada do nível atual do mercado subjacente.</li><li>Os contratos não podem expirar no fim-de-semana; portanto, a data de vencimento de um contrato pode ser adiada para a segunda-feira seguinte, caso a data de vencimento caia num sábado ou domingo.</li><li>Os preços de mercado são atualizados no máximo uma vez por segundo. Para qualquer determinado segundo, o preço de mercado será atualizado para o primeiro tique-taque, se houver algum, recebido no segundo específico no feed de dados da empresa.</li><li>A Empresa não garante a capacidade de vender um contrato antes de seu vencimento.</li></ul><h2 data-anchor="contract-payouts">Pagamentos de Contrato</h2><p>Os pagamentos do contrato serão determinados pela Empresa por referência às cotações de mercado exibidas no website relevante ao(s) índice(s) subjacente(s) do(s) contrato(s) ou a partir dos dados de negociação interbancária recebidos pela Companhia para cotações de câmbio ou preços de commodities conforme exibidos no website, desde que a Empresa tenha o direito de fazer correções em tais dados em caso de dados incorretos ou tipograficamente incorretos. Os clientes devem observar que mercados diferentes podem fechar em horários diferentes durante o dia devido ao horário e fuso horário de negociação local.</p><p>Para cotações forex, os horários de fechamento são definidos pela Empresa como mostrado na seção Horário de Negociação do mercado em nosso site. Em caso de qualquer disputa sobre valores de mercado ou de liquidação, a decisão da Companhia será final e vinculante. Os clientes devem observar que certos mercados (tais como índices) não estão abertos durante todo o dia e que a negociação pode não estar disponível quando os mercados estão fechados.</p><p>O cálculo do preço a ser pago (ou prêmio a ser recebido) por contratos financeiros neste site no momento em que o contrato financeiro é comprado ou vendido será baseado na melhor estimativa dos movimentos de preços de mercado e no nível esperado de taxas de juros, volatilidade implícita e outras condições ao longo da duração do contrato financeiro e baseia-se em matemática complexa. O cálculo incluirá uma parcialidade a favor da Empresa. Os preços de contratos financeiros (ou as quantias de prêmios) oferecidos aos Clientes que especulam no mercado ou sobre preços de índices podem diferir substancialmente dos preços disponíveis nos mercados primários, onde são negociadas matérias-primas ou contratos, devido à parcialidade que favorece a Empresa no sistema de cálculo de preço acima referido.</p><p>Os dados de gráficos disponibilizados aos clientes da Empresa é apenas indicativo e podem, algumas vezes, ser diferente dos valores reais de mercado. A decisão da empresa quanto ao cálculo de um preço de contrato financeiro será definitiva e decisiva. A Empresa oferece a opção de vender alguns contratos antes do tempo de expiração desses contratos, mas não será obrigada a fazê-lo e pode suspender essa opção, dependendo das condições dos mercado atuais. Os contratos podem ser alterados quando o valor do ativo é ajustado por ações corporativas durante o período do contrato.</p><p>Caso ocorra uma interrupção que não possa ser prontamente retificada pela Empresa nos feeds de dados, a Empresa reserva-se o direito de reembolsar a compra do contrato.</p><h2 data-anchor="trading-limits">Limites de Negociação</h2><p>A Empresa reserva-se o direito de impor limites de risco, o que afetará os limites de negociação de todos os clientes que estão negociando e pode não ser somente limitado a tipos de instrumentos e contratos.</p><p>A Empresa pode também impor limites sobre volumes de negociação em contas de cliente a seu exclusivo critério. Limites de volume de negociação podem ser consultados na seção &quot;Segurança e limites&quot; da sua conta. Se o saldo da sua conta exceder o tamanho máximo de conta, então deverão ser efetuadas retiradas para reduzir o saldo para abaixo desse limite.</p><p>Devido às responsabilidades sob o Jogo Responsável, Binary.com reserva o direito de avaliar e salvaguardar a conta do cliente definindo limites à atividade do cliente como proporcional e necessário para proteção dos mesmos.</p></p></div></div></div></div><div id="" class="section "><a id="deposit-bonus"></a><div class="section-content"><div id="section-3"><div data-show="-eucountry"><h2 data-anchor="deposit-bonus">Bônus de Depósito</h2><p>Este bônus será processado e creditado na conta de um cliente quando ambos os casos seguintes forem verdadeiros:</p><ol><li>O depósito mínimo necessário tiver sido feito pelo cliente.</li><li>O cliente atingiu um volume de negócios que é 5 vezes o montante do bônus.</li></ol><p>Tanto o valor do depósito como o valor do bônus são apresentados de forma clara quando este tipo de promoção está disponível.

Such clients&#x27; money bank accounts may be opened with EEA Institutions or Institutions outside the EEA.

Under these contracts and subject to the specific terms of the relevant contract, in consideration for the premium or price that clients pay BIEL, BIEL promises to pay clients a certain amount if the reference assets or measurements perform in a particular manner. These contracts accordingly are not instruments that BIEL holds on clients&#x27; behalf and neither benefits from clients&#x27; assets protection in the event of BIEL&#x27;s insolvency. Similarly, the premium or price that clients pay to take out a trade is not held as clients&#x27; money but as consideration for BIEL&#x27;s undertaking to pay.</p><p>The client acknowledges and agrees to the following:<ul class="bullet"><li>The Company will not pay interest on the Client Money.</li><li>Where the Client&#x27;s obligations to the Company are due and payable, the Company shall cease to treat as Client Money the amount equal to the amount of such obligations.</li><li>The Company may use the Client Money for the purposes of meeting obligations that are incurred by the Company in connection with the margining, guaranteeing, securing, transferring, adjusting, or settling of the client&#x27;s dealings in derivatives.</li></ul></p><h2 data-anchor="investor-compensation-scheme">Regime de Compensação de Investidores</h2><p>BIEL forms part of <a href="http://www.compensationschemes.org.mt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Investor Compensation Scheme</a> (the &quot;Scheme&quot;), which is a rescue fund for investors that are clients of failed investment firms licensed by the MFSA.

If a Client&#x27;s Margin Level is less than the Margin Level set for their account, the Client has entered into a Margin Call and is required to increase their Margin Level above the account&#x27;s specified level in order to avoid a Stop Out to occur. The Client may not be able to place an Order to open a Transaction unless there is sufficient Account Equity to cover the Total Margin.</li><li>The Client acknowledges that it is their responsibility to monitor their Account Balance and Margin Requirement, and the Company is not under any obligation to keep the Client informed (i.e. to make a Margin Call).</li></ol></li><li>Margin Requirement and calculation<p><ol><li>Margin Requirement is the amount that the Client needs to have in their account prior to entering into a trade and it is a percentage of the value of that trade.

The negative balance is determined by aggregating all the negative balances incurred over a 24-hour period across all accounts held by the Client. The Client acknowledges that, unless they are a retail customer of Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd, the offer of the Negative Balance protection by the Company to the Client is at the Company&#x27;s sole discretion and the Company reserves the right to change the features and eligibility criteria of the Negative Balance Protection at any time.

If the Client chooses to trade FX and CFDs, the Client shall transfer funds from their Binary.com account to their MT5 Real Account. Such a transfer shall not be regarded as a transfer from two different accounts but as a transfer of funds from the Client&#x27;s centralised Binary.com account to the MT5 Real Account. No fund transfers shall be made to any other account in the name of any third party.</p><p>The Client agrees to comply with the following when making payments to BIEL:</p><ol><li>Deposits and/or payments due are to be made in the currency chosen by the Client from the ones specified by BIEL from time to time.</li><li>The Client is responsible for all third-party electronic transfer fees in respect of payments.</li><li>Payments made to BIEL will only be deemed to have been received once BIEL receives cleared funds.</li><li>The Client bears the responsibility of ensuring that payments made to BIEL are correctly received with the specified Client&#x27;s account details.</li></ol><p>There are no charges for transferring money from the Client&#x27;s Binary.com account to their MT5 Real Account.</p></li><li>Transfer of funds from the MT5 Real Account<p>If the Client has a positive balance in their MT5 Real Account, they may transfer such balance from their MT5 Real Account into their Binary.com account and then request a withdrawal as necessary for any amount available on their Binary.com account. The Company may withhold, deduct, or refuse to make any such transfer or withdrawal, in whole or in part, if</p><ol><li>The Client has Open Positions on the account that show a loss.</li><li>Such a transfer would result in the Client&#x27;s Account Equity dropping to less than zero.</li><li>The requested transfer would reduce the Client&#x27;s Account Balance to less than the Margin required for the Client&#x27;s Open Positions.</li><li>The Company reasonably considers that funds may be required to meet any current or future Margin Requirements on Open Positions due to the underlying market conditions.</li><li>The Company reasonably determines that there is an unresolved dispute between the Company and the Client relating to the agreed terms and conditions.</li><li>There is an amount outstanding from the Client to BIEL.</li><li>BIEL is required to do so in accordance with any relevant law or regulation.</li></ol><p>The Client&#x27;s MT5 Real Account as well as all payments and withdrawals therefrom must be made in the same currency as maintained in the Client&#x27;s Binary.com account.</p></li><li>Proteção contra saldos negativos<p>When using the MT5 trading platform, all BIEL&#x27;s clients will be provided with Margin monitoring functionality to protect the Clients from encountering negative balances when trading under normal market conditions. As a trader, the Client should always maintain the appropriate levels of Margin in their trading account as the recommended method of their own risk management.</p><p>If the Client&#x27;s usable Margin drops below 100%, a Margin Call mode will be triggered and maintained till the level of 50%. In the event that the Client&#x27;s Margin Level is equal to, or drops below 50%, the Company will initiate the closing of the Client&#x27;s current Open Positions, starting from the most unprofitable, until the required Margin Level is achieved. In such events, the positions will be automatically closed at the current market price at that point in time.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances, where there is a price change in the underlying that is sufficiently large and sudden, gapping can occur. In such cases, the automatic Margin close-out protection might fail, causing the Client&#x27;s Account Balance to fall below zero. For this purpose, a Negative Balance Protection mechanism has been introduced. Negative Balance Protection provides a &#x27;backstop&#x27; in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that the Client&#x27;s maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on the Client&#x27;s CFD account. Therefore, the Client can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if the Client&#x27;s CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to the Client.</p><p>Negative Balance Protection does not apply to the Clients categorised as Professional Traders, who can still lose more money than their available balance.</p><p>The Company does not offer credit to its Clients. The Client acknowledges and agrees that they will not be dealing with the Company on credit.</p></li></ol></li><li><strong>Encerramento de Conta</strong><p>If the Client wishes to withdraw funds from their MT5 Real Account and/or close their MT5 Real Account, the Client may notify the Company by contacting the helpdesk at <a href="mailto:support@binary.com">support@binary.com</a>.

The purpose of this filtering algorithm is to strip the feed of stray ticks. Stray ticks are ticks that manifestly fall outside of the current trading range of the market; such ticks are often due to communication delays with the exchanges or banks that provide quotes, human error, or database problems at any point between the originator of the quote and the Company&#x27;s servers.</p><p>The filtering algorithm may for example be similar to the &quot;Bollinger Bands&quot; volatility system, i.e. short-term volatility bands are determined around the present market value, and ticks that are manifestly outside of such bands are removed.</p><h2 data-anchor="smoothing-out-random-noise">Suavizar ruído aleatório</h2><p>Depending on the quality of the feeds received from the Company&#x27;s feed providers, the Company&#x27;s servers might also apply a very short-term smoothing algorithm to the data feed. This smoothing algorithm removes a little of the &quot;random noise&quot; surrounding the data feed and ensures that clients who buy path-dependent contracts (such as the one-touch or barrier-range contracts) will not have their contracts knocked in or knocked out by random short-term market noise that does not reflect the true market price.</p><h2 data-anchor="differences-with-other-data-feeds">Diferenças com outros feeds de dados</h2><p>The Company&#x27;s data feed may at times differ slightly from other data feeds found on the Internet (who may themselves differ from each other). Reasons for differences in feed providers include:</p><ul><li>For forex: The forex market is an OTC (over the counter) market, where banks and other major financial institutions trade currencies amongst themselves without there being any central clearing house. Accordingly, there is no &#x27;official&#x27; price source for forex quotes. Different data feeds will contain quotes from a different sub-set of international banks. Accordingly, prices may differ among providers, depending on which bank(s) they obtain prices from.</li><li>Os algoritmos de suavização e de filtragem descritos abaixo.</li><li>Market-closing times: The client is asked to refer to <a href="/binary-static/pt/resources/market_timesws.html">Trading times</a> page for the exact time of settlement for all contracts. Other websites may adopt a different convention (for example, some websites choose 4 o&#x27;clock NY time or 5 o&#x27;clock London time). As a result, the open, high, low, and closing prices displayed on the Company&#x27;s website may differ from those on other websites, due to the market-closing time convention.</li><li>Use of bid/ask prices: When the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many bid and ask prices, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the bid/ask price (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. The Company&#x27;s system will generate prices from these bid and ask prices, whereas other websites might not. As a result, the Company&#x27;s website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.</li></ul><p>The Company&#x27;s data feed is designed to be one of the best and most robust available for a trading environment.</p><h2 data-anchor="weekend-quotes">Cotações de fim-de-semana</h2><p>The client is asked to note that weekend quotes are ignored for the purpose of contract settlement. During weekends, the forex markets may occasionally generate prices; however, these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push prices up or down). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is Binary.com&#x27;s policy not to count weekend prices towards contract settlement values (except for Volatility Indices, which are open during weekends).</p></div></div><div id="privacy-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="security-and-privacy">Segurança e privacidade</h2><p>The Company recognises the importance of protecting the client&#x27;s personal and financial information.</p><p>All the information that the Company obtains about the client assists the Company in servicing the client and the client&#x27;s account.

The Company does not sell the client&#x27;s personal information to third parties, but the Company may provide it to payment providers to facilitate transactions on the client&#x27;s account.</p><p>The client&#x27;s personal information is used primarily as a way of validating the client as the legitimate account owner and proper recipient of withdrawal payments. The Company also uses this information to process the client&#x27;s trades. The Company collects from the client all personal and financial data directly relating to the client when the client fills in the Company&#x27;s account opening form. In all instances, the client has either a legal or a contractual obligation to provide the Company with the information. If such information is not provided, the Company will be unable to provide the client with its services.</p><p>The Company reserves the right to request further information from the client whenever deemed appropriate under the circumstances. For example, the Company may ask the client to send the Company additional acceptable documents to confirm the authenticity of the client&#x27;s account details or of any withdrawal request.</p><p>The Company holds all the personal data that the Company collects from the client with due diligence and only processes them for purposes as required or allowed by law. This includes the process of obtaining and sharing of certain information with third parties for credit or identity checks to comply with legal and regulatory obligations. In certain cases, the Company may process the client&#x27;s data to fulfill the Company&#x27;s contractual obligations with the client.</p><p>The Company also collects basic tax residence information for the purposes of CRS/FATCA compliance. The tax information that the client provides may only be disclosed to the authorities who are legally charged with collecting this information for CRS/FATCA reporting, and Binary.com will only do so to the extent that is legally obliged to collect it from the clients and disclose it to the authorities. The Company does not use, disclose, or process this information in any other way at any time.</p><p>The client may update the client&#x27;s personal information at any time by logging in to the &quot;Settings&quot; section of the client&#x27;s account. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that Binary.com is promptly and continually informed of any change in the client&#x27;s personal information. The client should note that if the client provides the Company with inaccurate information, or if the client fails to notify the Company of any changes to the information previously supplied by the client, this may adversely affect the quality of the services that the Company can provide.</p><h2 data-anchor="profiling-and-categorisation">Profiling and categorisation</h2><p>The Company collects and assesses the client&#x27;s data to profile the client in relation to the Company&#x27;s products.

When this feature is enabled, no other personally identifiable information other than the client&#x27;s Binary.com login ID, or other data that can be linked to such information by Google, is shared with or disclosed to Google.</p><div data-show="eucountry"><h2 data-anchor="transfer-of-data">Transfer of data</h2><p>The Company may also transfer relevant personal and financial data to any company within the Binary Group of companies. This includes any of the Company&#x27;s business associates or payment providers within or outside of the EEA, including countries that might not offer an equivalent level of protection of personal data. In all instances, the Company places a contractual obligation on such third parties to offer the same level of rights and protection as stipulated in the GDPR.</p><p>The client also has the right to request copies of any personal information that the client has provided to the Company and to request that the Company transmit such information to other service providers.</p><h2 data-anchor="consent">Autorização</h2><p>When the client opens an account with the Company, the Company will request the client&#x27;s consent for the distribution of marketing materials to the e-mail address that the client provides to the Company upon sign-up.</p><h2 data-anchor="right-of-object">Right to object</h2><p>The client has the right to object to the direct distribution of marketing materials.

The Company will do so unless legally prohibited. Such required disclosure shall not be interpreted as a breach of this terms and conditions agreement.</p><p>The client also has the right to request that the Company copy, modify, or remove the client&#x27;s personal information as long as such actions do not breach any legal or regulatory obligations that the Company may have.</p></div><h2 data-anchor="data-retention">Retenção de dados</h2><p>If the client chooses to close the client&#x27;s Binary.com account, the client&#x27;s data will be kept only until the Company&#x27;s legal and regulatory obligations on data retention are met. The Company will delete the client&#x27;s data once the applicable retention period expires.</p><h2 data-anchor="security-statement">Security statement</h2><p>Taking the following measures, the Company is committed to making sure that the client&#x27;s personal data and transactions are secure:</p><ol><li>The client&#x27;s password and login ID are unique, and passwords are hashed so that not even Binary.com staff can read them.

If the client is in any doubt about the risks involved with Investment Products or Gambling Products, the client should seek professional advice.</p><p>If the client chooses to enter into a contract with the Company, it is important that the client remains aware of the risks involved, that the client has adequate investment resources to bear such risks, and that the client monitors the client&#x27;s positions carefully.</p><h2 data-anchor="general-risks">General risks</h2><p></p><h4>No advice</h4><p>The Company&#x27;s services are provided on an execution-only basis. The Company does not provide investment advice in relation to the Company&#x27;s products or services.

However, any decision to use the Company&#x27;s products or services is made by the client.</p><p>The client is responsible for managing the client&#x27;s tax and legal affairs, including making any regulatory filings and payments and complying with applicable laws and regulations. The Company does not provide any regulatory, tax, or legal advice. If the client is in any doubt as to the tax treatment or liabilities of Investment Products or Gambling Products available through Binary.com, the client may wish to seek independent advice.</p><h4>Adequação</h4><p>Investment Products to EEA residents are provided by Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd (&quot;BIEL&quot;), which is authorised and regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority under the Malta Investment Services Act to deal on own account in Investment Products.</p><p>Before the Company opens an account for the client in which the client can trade or invest in Investment Products with BIEL, the Company is required to make an assessment of whether the Investment Products or services that the client has chosen are appropriate for the client and to warn the client if, on the basis of the information that the client has provided to the Company, any such product or service is deemed not appropriate for the client. Any decision to open an account and to use the Company&#x27;s products or services is the client&#x27;s.

The Company does not monitor on the client&#x27;s behalf whether the amount of money that the client has sent to the Company or the client&#x27;s profits or losses are consistent with that information.

Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow the client to take a simple &quot;Yes or No&quot; approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, or indices; however, one of the most significant differences between Binary Options and traditional options, among others, is that there can only be two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option.</p><p>Trading in Binary Options is speculative and involves a high degree of risk that can result in the loss of the client&#x27;s entire investment. Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal, and other risks involved in such transactions. The client should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for the client in light of the client&#x27;s investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. The client should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless the client understands the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If the client is in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for the client, the client should seek independent advice from an investment consulting professional. Binary.com does not provide such advice. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility, taking into account the client&#x27;s personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in Binary Options with Binary.com and prior to making any individual order. Where the client does not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with Binary.com or in making any individual order, the client should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If the client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, the client should not trade at all.</p><p>The client is advised that the Binary Options offered by Binary.com are not traded under the rules of any recognised, designated, or regulated exchange. Consequently, engaging in Binary Options trading may expose the client to substantially greater risks than the investments that are so traded.</p><p>The client is warned of the following additional risks:</p><p>Derivative investment instruments such as Binary Options and related markets can be highly volatile. The prices of the underlying instrument that a Binary Option refers to may fluctuate rapidly and over wide ranges and may reflect unforeseeable events or changes in conditions, none of which can be controlled by the client or Binary.com.</p><p>Binary.com tries to maintain a reasonable relation between the quoted prices of each underlying asset that a Binary Option refers to and the actual market prices of such an asset. Binary.com makes no warranty, expressed or implied, that the quoted prices represent prevailing market prices.</p><p>Binary.com may have access to information that is not available to the client, may have acquired trading positions at prices that are not available to the client, and may have interests different from the client&#x27;s interests. Binary.com does not undertake any obligation to provide the client with market or other information that the Company possesses, nor to alter or refrain from the Company&#x27;s own trading.</p><p>Informações sobre o desempenho anterior de qualquer instrumento ou ativo subjacente não garante o seu desempenho atual e/ou futuro.

If the client deposits funds in a currency to trade contracts denominated in a different currency, the client&#x27;s gains or losses on the underlying investment may be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the currencies.</p><p>Other Risks: There are other risks related to trading Investment Products and foreign currencies that cannot be described in detail in this document. Generally, however, securities, options, and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. For example, there can be serious market disruptions if local or overseas economic, political, or other unforeseen events affect the market. In addition to these types of risk, there may be other factors such as accounting and tax treatment issues that the client should consider.</p><h2 data-anchor="market-opinions">Market opinions</h2><p>All opinions, news, research, analysis, prices, or other information contained on this website are provided as general market commentary and do not constitute investment advice.

The client should be aware of all costs and charges that apply to the client because they will affect the client&#x27;s profitability.</p><h2 data-anchor="cryptocurrency-risks">Cryptocurrency risks</h2><p>Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets that are extremely vulnerable to market fluctuations. Trading in cryptocurrencies is a highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down — potentially to a worthless (zero) value. The client should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless the client fully understands and is aware that trades and/or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature, and the client not only risks incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risks losing all the client&#x27;s invested capital.</p><p>If the client loses the client&#x27;s cryptocurrencies as a result of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers being hacked or becoming insolvent, there is no assurance of a recourse. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to store the client&#x27;s cryptocurrencies securely. Binary.com will not accept liability for any loss or damage that arises, directly or indirectly, from the theft of the client&#x27;s cryptocurrency or the insolvency of exchanges and wallet providers that the client uses.</p><p>Cryptocurrency-related transactions that occur on the blockchain might take place without the supervision and regulation of financial institutions and government agencies. The absence of an overarching authority overseeing cryptographic transactions means that there is no recourse to banks, payment service providers, or regulators in the event of erroneous or fraudulent transactions. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to check what rules and protections apply in the client&#x27;s relevant jurisdiction before investing and/or trading in virtual currency and/or trading on contracts for differences relating to virtual currency. The client should be aware of all the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor and/or legal advisor if the client has any doubts.</p></div></div><div id="risk-mt-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="risk-disclosure-statement">Risk disclosure statement</h2><p>This risk disclosure statement is not exhaustive and is not intended to constitute a comprehensive statement of all the risks to which the client might be exposed and does not describe all the risks inherent to forex and contracts for differences that exist now or which may arise in the future. Its objective is rather to provide the client with information, so that the client can reasonably understand the risks associated with forex and contracts for differences offered by Binary.com, as it is the Company&#x27;s intention to provide the client with the best possible trading experience.</p><h2 data-anchor="forex-and-cfd-high-risk">Câmbios e contratos por diferenças envolvem alto risco e são especulativos</h2><p>Forex and contract for differences transactions involve a high degree of risk and are speculative because they allow the client to speculate on the short-term price movements of the underlying financial instruments. The client should not enter into forex and/or contract-for-difference transactions unless the client is able to sustain losses that exceed the client&#x27;s deposited funds. It is important for the client to understand that in order to realise any value from the client&#x27;s open positions, the client would have to enter into a corresponding transaction to close the client&#x27;s open positions and may find it difficult or impossible to do so under certain market conditions.</p><h2 data-anchor="execution-model">Modelo de execução e risco de contraparte</h2><p>Binary.com offers forex and contracts for differences via a series of models - either solely dealing on own account (dealing desk), or wholly hedging client orders with the Company&#x27;s liquidity providers (no-dealing desk), or a hybrid model, depending on the Company with which the client has a contract. For the hybrid model, client orders are typically hedged when the total transaction volume exceeds a predefined threshold of risk tolerance level. For these execution models, Binary.com acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that the client enters into with the Company, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange-traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contract-for-difference transaction that the client has entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction&#x27;s cash flow.</p><h2 data-anchor="leverage">Alavancagem</h2><p>Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that the client would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than the client&#x27;s margin. When the client invests in a leveraged product, the client&#x27;s profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e. the increased/amplified value of the client&#x27;s trade is determined based on the leverage ratio that the client has set for the client&#x27;s account.</p><p>Leverage can be used to generate returns that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction (the client&#x27;s margin). However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against the client&#x27;s favour, the client will suffer losses that are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction (the client&#x27;s margin).</p><h2 data-anchor="relationship-between-margin-and-leverage">Relationship between margin and leverage</h2><p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times that the client&#x27;s margin (the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be &quot;leveraged&quot; to enter into a transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always one. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that the Company/the client establishes will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, as the leverage that the client sets for the client&#x27;s account gets lower, the margin required to be set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance (the client&#x27;s margin requirement) gets higher.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-stop-order">Risk of stop order</h2><p>The system fills orders on a first-in, first-out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond the Company&#x27;s control. As a result, the client may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in the client&#x27;s stop order during certain market conditions. The placement of stop order by the client, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit the client&#x27;s losses to the client&#x27;s intended amounts in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders, and there is uncertainty about the client&#x27;s possible exit price. In short, a stop order is not guaranteed because it cannot operate in all market circumstances.</p><h2 data-anchor="regular-monitoring">Monitoramento regular das posições em aberto</h2><p>Trading forex and contracts for differences carries a high level of risk and Binary.com does not monitor the open positions of the client&#x27;s account on the client&#x27;s behalf. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to monitor the client&#x27;s open positions and understand the exposure of the client&#x27;s open positions whilst ensuring that the client&#x27;s exposure commensurate with the client&#x27;s risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, the client should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which the client ordinarily transacts instead of investing in a CFD.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-slippage">Risco de derrapagem</h2><p>Whilst the Company endeavours to open or close the transaction to which the client&#x27;s orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with the Company&#x27;s duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that the client&#x27;s order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when the client places their order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to the client) or a negative slippage (less favourable to the client).</p><h2 data-anchor="external-forces">Forças externas</h2><p>The client&#x27;s forex and contract-for-difference transactions with Binary.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument, and the client will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate, or other volatility of the market to which the client&#x27;s financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to the client. Forex and contract-for-difference trading over the Internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk, which may result in delays in order execution.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-cryptocurrency-cfd">Risk of cryptocurrency contracts for differences</h2><p>Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets that are extremely vulnerable to market fluctuations. Trading cryptocurrency contracts for differences is a highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down — potentially to a worthless (zero) value. Investing in cryptocurrency contracts for differences through leveraged accounts amplifies this underlying volatility risk, making the change in prices even more significant. When the client invests in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, the client&#x27;s profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio that the client has set for the client&#x27;s account. If the price movement is in the client&#x27;s favour, returns generated are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against the client&#x27;s favour, the client will suffer losses that are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction. The client should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless the client fully understands and is aware that trades and/or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature, and the client not only risks incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risks losing all the client&#x27;s invested capital.</p></div></div><div id="order-execution-binary-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="summary-order-execution-policy">Resumo da política de execução de ordens</h2><p>The Company has a general duty to conduct its business with the client honestly, fairly, and professionally and to act in the client&#x27;s best interests when opening and closing Binary Options trades with the client.</p><p>More specifically, when the Company enters into a Binary Option trade with the client (each, a &quot;Contract&quot;), the Company has a duty to provide the client with &#x27;best execution&#x27;.

Client orders will be executed by the Company and the Company will always be the client&#x27;s sole execution venue for all of the trades a client makes in binary options. This means that the Company will always act as the client&#x27;s counterparty, wherein it takes the other side of the client&#x27;s trade.
